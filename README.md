# Supply-Chain-Network-Optimization-Excel

This repository contains an Excel-based Operations Research assignment implementing six network optimization models using Excel formulas + Solver. The models cover transportation, fixed-charge decisions, capacity scenarios, and transshipment network flows (single- and multi-product).

# What’s inside

Model 1: Transportation problem (min-cost shipping from supply cities to demand cities)

Model 2–3: Transportation + fixed cost / facility activation decisions (fixed-charge extension)

Model 4: Scenario-based network planning (e.g., low vs high capacity / cost scenarios)

Model 5: Transshipment network flow (single product) with arc capacity constraints and min-cost objective

Model 6: Transshipment network flow (multiple products) (multi-commodity extension)

# Key skills demonstrated

Network modeling (transportation, transshipment)

Constraint modeling (supply, demand, capacity, arc limits)

Objective formulation (min total cost)

Excel analytics: Pivot-style summaries, structured tables, SUMPRODUCT-based objective

Solver-based optimization and scenario interpretation
